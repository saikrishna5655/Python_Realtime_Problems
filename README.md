# Customer Complaint and Product Sales Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs two data analysis tasks:

1.  **Customer Complaint Analyzer**: Analyzes a list of customer complaints to find the most frequent keywords, ignoring common English stopwords. This helps in identifying common issues reported by customers.

2.  **Product Sales Aggregator**: Aggregates the total quantity sold for each product from a list of sales orders and sorts the products by the total quantity sold in descending order. This provides insights into best-selling products.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook is structured into sections for each task, including:

*   Input data
*   Steps for data processing (cleaning, tokenization, filtering stopwords, aggregation)
*   Results and summaries

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.
3.  Examine the output cells to see the results of the keyword analysis and product sales aggregation.

## Requirements

The notebook uses standard Python libraries and `collections`. If running locally, ensure you have Python installed. If using Google Colab, all necessary libraries are pre-installed.
